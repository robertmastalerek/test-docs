Regardless of the architecture of your application setup, the process engine always requires this database schema. In a production environment, we recommend setting up this schema yourself and reference the prepared database instance in your application configuration. Consult the installation guide related to your setup to configure the database for a remote engine, shared engine, or embedded engine accordingly.</description></item><item><title>Dashboard</title><link>/test-docs/webapps/cockpit/cmmn/dashboard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/test-docs/webapps/cockpit/cmmn/dashboard/</guid><description>Enterprise Feature Please note that this feature is only included in the enterprise edition of Camunda 7, it is not available in the community edition.

A subprocess is completely defined inside a parent process (that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s often called an embedded Subprocess).
Subprocesses have two major use cases:
Subprocesses allow hierarchical modeling.

This concept simplifies reuse of plan item definitions and furthermore enables dynamic planning so that additional items can be generated from a definition at runtime.

The difference is that the call activity references a process that is external to the process definition, whereas the subprocess is embedded within the original process definition. The main use case for the call activity is to have a reusable process definition that can be called from multiple other process definitions.</description></item><item><title>Camunda 7 License Book</title><link>/test-docs/introduction/third-party-libraries/camunda-bpm-platform-license-book/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/test-docs/introduction/third-party-libraries/camunda-bpm-platform-license-book/</guid><description>Java Dependencies logback-classic@1.5.7(EPL 1.0)Copyright (C) 1999-2024, QOS.ch.

A plan item may be required, meaning that it has to reach an end-like state before the containing stage can complete. Whether a plan item is required can be specified by a required rule.
This rule is evaluated when the milestone, stage or task is instantiated and transitions to the state AVAILABLE, and its result value of type boolean is maintained throughout the remainder of the case instance.</description></item><item><title>Resource Deployments</title><link>/test-docs/user-guide/quarkus-integration/deployments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/test-docs/user-guide/quarkus-integration/deployments/</guid><description>This section documents how to perform process engine deployments with a Quarkus application containing an embedded process engine. The documentation assumes some familiarity with Quarkus CDI support and the Camunda DeploymentBuilder API.
The Camunda Engine Quarkus Extension only supports programmatic deployments. A user can observe for the CamundaEngineStartupEvent CDI event. The CamundaEngineStartupEvent signals that a process engine has been successfully bootstrapped, and a deployment can be performed.
The following example shows how a single process engine deployment can be performed in a Quarkus application:</description></item><item><title>Rolling Update</title><link>/test-docs/update/rolling-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/test-docs/update/rolling-update/</guid><description>Limits for Rolling Updates Rolling updates are not possible prior to Version 7.5.

Input Expression: sets the input value for an input column of the decision table Input Entry: used to determine if a rule of the decision table is applicable Output Entry: returns a value which is added to the output of a matched rule of the decision table Literal Expression: used to determine the value of a decision literal expression You can read more on this in the DMN 1.</description></item><item><title>Extending Connect</title><link>/test-docs/reference/connect/extending-connect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/test-docs/reference/connect/extending-connect/</guid><description>Configuring Connectors The connectors available to Connect may not always suit your needs. Sometimes, it is necessary to provide configuration.
To configure a connector detected by Spin, the SPI org.camunda.connect.spi.ConnectorConfigurator can be implemented. A configurator specifies which classes it can configure. Connect discovers a configurator by employing Java&amp;rsquo;s service loader mechanism and will then provide it with all connectors that match the specified class (or are a subclass thereof). The concrete configuration options depend on the actual connector.</description></item><item><title>Extending Spin</title><link>/test-docs/reference/spin/extending-spin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/test-docs/reference/spin/extending-spin/</guid><description>Configuring Data Formats The data formats available to Spin may not always suit your needs. Sometimes, it is necessary to provide configuration. For example, when using Spin to map Java objects to JSON, a format for how dates are serialized has to specified.

When the process execution arrives at a Receive Task, the process state is committed to the persistence storage. This means that the process will stay in this wait state until a specific message is received by the engine, which triggers continuation of the process beyond the Receive Task.
A Receive Task with a message reference can be triggered like an ordinary event:</description></item><item><title>Reports</title><link>/test-docs/webapps/cockpit/reporting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/test-docs/webapps/cockpit/reporting/</guid><description>You can use the reports section of cockpit to display custom statistics and reports.

A job is created when a timer event or a task marked for asynchronous execution (see transaction boundaries) is approached. Job processing can therefore be separated into three phases:
Job Creation Job Acquisition Job Execution While jobs are created during process execution, job acquisition and execution are the job executor&amp;rsquo;s responsibility.

For each tenant, certain guarantees of isolation should be made. For example, one tenant&amp;rsquo;s process instances should not interfere with those of another tenant.
Multi-Tenancy can be achieved in two different ways. One way is to use one process engine per tenant. The other way is to use just one process engine and associate the data with tenant identifiers.</description></item><item><title>Id Generators</title><link>/test-docs/user-guide/process-engine/id-generator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/test-docs/user-guide/process-engine/id-generator/</guid><description>All persistent entities managed by the process engine (Process Instances, Tasks, &amp;hellip;) have unique Ids. These Ids uniquely identify an individual task, process instance, etc. When these entities are persisted to the database, the ids are used as primary keys in the corresponding database tables.
Out of the box, the process engine provides two Id generator implementations.

Such incidents usually indicate some kind of problem related to process execution. Examples of such incidents may be a failed job with depleted retries (retries = 0), indicating that an execution is stuck and manual administrative action is necessary to repair the process instance. If such incidents arise, the process engine fires an internal event which can be handled by a configurable incident handler.</description></item><item><title>Security Instructions</title><link>/test-docs/user-guide/security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/test-docs/user-guide/security/</guid><description>This page provides an overview of how to secure a Camunda installation.

This makes it possible to configure which user can access which process instances, tasks, etc&amp;hellip;
Authorization has a performance cost and introduces some complexity. It should only be used if required.
When is Authorization required? Not every Camunda setup needs to enable authorization. In many scenarios, Camunda is embedded into an application and the application itself ensures that users can only access data they are authorized to access.</description></item><item><title>Deployments</title><link>/test-docs/user-guide/process-engine/deployments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/test-docs/user-guide/process-engine/deployments/</guid><description>Before a process (or case, or decision) can be executed by the process engine, it has to be deployed. A deployment is a logical entity that groups multiple resources that are deployed together. Deployments can be made programmatically via Java API or REST API, or declaratively for resources of a Process Application. This section covers advanced deployment concepts.
